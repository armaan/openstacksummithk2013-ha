Slides from the 2nd Swiss OpenStack User Group Meetup
=====================================================

February 19, 2013

These slides rely on impress.js, which they expect to be checked out
into a sibling directory named `impress.js`.

In other words, after you clone _this_ repository, make sure you do
the following:

    cd ..
    git clone git://github.com/bartaz/impress.js

Then, just open `index.html` (from this repo) in your favorite browser.
I've found Chrome/Chromium to work best; in Firefox the transitions and
animations can be a bit jerky at times.

Oh, and please don't even ask about IE, thank you.
